# IPL Dashboard

A Flask web application that displays IPL Fantasy players data fetched in real-time from the official API, along with a transfer optimizer for generating optimal transfer plans.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the development server
python3 src/server/server.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## Features

- **Real-time API fetching** - Data fetched on-demand from IPL Fantasy API
- **Four pages**:
  - **All Players** - Full player list with filters and sorting
  - **Today's Match** - Side-by-side home/away team tables
  - **Next Match** - Side-by-side tables for all teams (upcoming match planning)
  - **Transfers** - Complete match-by-match transfer history with team-wise player counts
- **Sortable columns** - Click any header to sort (default: Playing XI first)
- **Team filter** - Filter players by team
- **Playing XI filter** - Show only players in today's squad
- **Visual indicators**:
  - Green text = Playing XI
  - Bold text = Announced squad
- **Stats cards** - Total players, announced squad, avg points, playing XI count

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages (Recommended)

Deploy to GitHub Pages for free hosting. The site fetches fresh data via GitHub Actions.

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository **Settings > Pages**
   - Under "Source", select **GitHub Actions**

2. **Deploy**:
   - The workflow automatically deploys on push to `main`
   - Scheduled data updates run daily at 9:30-9:40 UTC (every 2 minutes)
   - Your site will be available at `https://your-username.github.io/ipl-dashboard/`

3. **Manual trigger**:
   - Go to **Actions** > "Deploy to GitHub Pages" > "Run workflow"

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Serve main HTML page |
| `/api/players` | GET | Fetch players from IPL Fantasy API |
| `/api/today-matches` | GET | Get today's and next match info |
| `/api/transfers` | GET | Get transfer history data |
| `/api/health` | GET | Health check endpoint |

## Transfer Optimizer

The project includes a transfer optimizer that generates optimal transfer plans across the 70-match IPL league stage using a total budget of 160 transfers.

See [src/transfer_optimizer/README.md](src/transfer_optimizer/README.md) for details on:
- How the beam search optimization works
- Input/output file formats
- Command line options
- Running the optimizer and tests

## Utility Scripts

### fetch_players.py

Optional utility to pre-fetch API data (useful for offline use or backups):

```bash
python3 src/utils/fetch_players.py
```

Note: The web app fetches data dynamically from the API, so this script is optional.
